# MyGame

## Introduction

Welcome to MyGame - an innovative app that serves as an academic forum for high school students. Contrary to its name, MyGame is not a conventional game but an interactive platform where students can post and answer questions about homework, classroom concepts, and teachers. It's a unique space tailored to high school students, drawing inspiration from platforms like Quora, but with a specific focus on high school subjects and educational experiences.

## Value and Use

MyGame fills a crucial gap for students transitioning from middle to upper school who need insights on what to expect from new teachers and classes. It also serves as an invaluable resource for students grappling with challenging assignments in subjects like chemistry and physics, where teacher support may sometimes fall short. The app ensures that help is just a post away, enabling students to share resources, provide answers, and support each other academically.

### Key Features:

- **Student-Only Community:** Access is exclusive to students, ensuring a safe space away from faculty oversight, while respecting the integrity of the honor code.
- **Anonymity in Participation:** Users can ask and answer questions anonymously, promoting a candid and fear-free environment for information exchange.
- **Class-Specific Forums:** Tailored discussions based on the classes you are taking, allowing for targeted and relevant academic support.
- **Notifications:** Stay updated with real-time alerts when your questions are answered or commented on.

## UI/UX

The user interface of MyGame mirrors the intuitive design of popular forums like Quora and Reddit, with a student-centric twist. Upon signing up—through a secure process that verifies student identity without compromising privacy—users can customize their experience based on the classes they are enrolled in, engage with the most upvoted questions, and contribute to the academic community.

### Engagement Loop:

1. **Sign-Up/Login:** A secure entry point to verify student status.
2. **Class Selection:** Personalize your feed by selecting your current classes.
3. **Interaction:** Upvote, comment on, or answer questions.
4. **Contribution:** Post your own questions anonymously.
5. **Notification System:** Opt-in for updates to stay engaged.

## Competitive Element

While MyGame is inherently cooperative, a gamified aspect could be considered to foster engagement. This could include earning points for contributing quality answers, although the primary aim remains to be the support and academic growth of the student community.

## Scalability and Expansion

The potential for scaling MyGame is significant. Starting with individual high schools, we envision a network of school-specific forums that maintain a shared space for inter-school collaboration on homework and conceptual questions, thereby enhancing the breadth and depth of academic support.

## Accessibility and Inclusivity

MyGame is committed to creating an inclusive environment. Any student, regardless of background or school, can seek and offer help. A robust reporting system will be in place to handle any instances of hate speech or discrimination, ensuring the platform remains respectful and supportive.

### Inclusivity Features:

- **Universal Access:** Open to all students seeking academic assistance.
- **Report Functionality:** A tool for users to report inappropriate content, safeguarding the integrity of the discussion space.
